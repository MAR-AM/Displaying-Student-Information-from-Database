# Displaying-Student-Information-from-Database
This PHP script connects to a MySQL database and retrieves student information from the etudiant table. It then dynamically generates an HTML table to display the student's ID, name, surname, date of birth, and address. The data is fetched using PDO and iterated over to populate the table rows.
